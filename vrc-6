| VRC 6 | Baseline Rewards for Top 16 DLPs | Status | Type  | Author Ryan Kuhel and ryan@dlp-labs.com | 2025-01-07 |

## Abstract

This VRC proposes establishing a baseline staking reward of 10,000 $VANA for the top 16 Data Liquidity Pools (DLPs). The objective is to incentivize emerging DLPs to participate in the ecosystem, promote equitable $VANA distribution, and mitigate risks associated with reward concentration by large stakeholders. The implementation of this proposal will strengthen ecosystem integrity and incentivize meaningful contributions.
  
## Motivation

The Vana ecosystem thrives on active participation and fair distribution of resources. However, the current staking model presents challenges:

Emergent DLPs are not incentivized meaningfully for achieving a top 16 position. 

Emergent DLPs face barriers to ecosystem participation, as $VANA is required to earn DLP rewards, reducing overall diversity and innovation.

Stakers may create fake DLPs to capture staking rewards, undermining genuine ecosystem builders.

Full concentration of DLP rewards to top two or three DLPs is not healthy for the ecosystem 

This proposal ensures baseline rewards for the top 16 DLPs, encouraging sustainable growth, fair distribution, and alignment with ecosystem goals.


## Specification

Proposed Changes

Establish a fixed baseline reward of 10,000 $VANA per DLP for the top 16 ranked DLPs.

Rank determination based on DLP activity, contribution, and compliance with ecosystem standards.

Implement safeguards to prevent reward abuse, such as:

Verification processes to identify genuine DLPs.

Mechanisms to prevent manipulation of staking metrics.

Ensure rewards are distributed monthly, aligning with existing $VANA tokenomics.

  ## Rationale

    Baseline Reward: Ensures emerging DLPs are incentivized to participate, fostering ecosystem growth.

    Top 16 DLPs: Strikes a balance between inclusivity and practicality, focusing rewards on significant contributors.

    Fixed Reward Amount: Simplifies reward calculations, ensuring predictable incentives.

    Alternatives Considered

      Pure Staking Rewards Percentage: Rejected due to lack of incentive for emerging DLPS potential for manipulation.

      Reward Allocation to All DLPs: Deemed inefficient, as it dilutes incentives for genuine contributors.

    Dependencies and Assumptions

      Vana will attract and retain high quality projects with a more robust baseline reward mechanism 

      Top performing DLPs can still be incentivized with baseline rewards for emerging DLPs 


## Security & Privacy Considerations

Potential Risks

  Fake DLP Creation: Mitigated through verification processes.

  Whale Manipulation: Addressed by limiting rewards to the top 16 DLPs and requiring compliance with contribution standards.

  Data Privacy Concerns: Ensures that DLP ranking mechanisms do not expose sensitive data.

Risk Mitigation Strategies

  Regular audits of DLP ranking and reward distribution processes.

  Encourage staking v. fake DLP creation 

  Transparent communication with stakeholders.



## Implementation

Required Changes

  Update reward distribution mechanisms to incorporate baseline rewards.

Migration Strategy

  Update rewards for epoch 2 

Timeline Estimates

  Pilot Program Epoch 2 

Testing Requirements

  Simulate reward distribution under various scenarios.

  Validate ranking and verification mechanisms for accuracy and robustness.
