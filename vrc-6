| VRC 6 | Autostaking of $VANA | Status | Type  | Author Ryan Kuhel and ryan@dlp-labs.com | 2025-01-13 |

## Abstract

This VRC proposes enabling auto-staking of $VANA rewards within the Vana Hub to improve user experience for DLP creators and stakers. The current manual claiming and restaking process is time-consuming and creates multiple rows of staked $VANA, adding unnecessary complexity. Auto-staking would streamline the process by automatically reinvesting rewards while offering a bonus incentive to users, enhancing the protocol's attractiveness and usability.
  
## Motivation

Currently, $VANA rewards are issued to stakers and DLP creators, who must claim these rewards manually and restake them to compound their holdings. 

This process has several drawbacks:
# Cumbersome User Experience: Users must frequently interact with the platform, leading to frustration and inefficiency.
# Fragmented Stakes: Manual restaking results in multiple rows of staked $VANA, complicating tracking and management.
# Lost Growth Opportunities: The effort required may discourage some users from maximizing their returns through regular restaking.

By introducing auto-staking, users can automatically reinvest their rewards with minimal effort, creating a seamless "set it and forget it" experience. A small bonus for using auto-staking will encourage adoption and reward user loyalty.


## Specification

Proposed Changes

Technical Implementation

Auto-Staking Option:
Introduce a toggle within the Vana Hub interface allowing users to enable auto-staking for their $VANA rewards.
Once enabled, rewards are automatically staked upon distribution, compounding the user's stake without requiring manual intervention.

Bonus Incentive:
Offer a small percentage bonus on auto-staked rewards (e.g., 1–2%) to encourage adoption.
The bonus will be funded through the existing reward pool.

Smart Contract Changes:

Modify the staking smart contract to include an auto-staking function that:
Automatically reinvests rewards upon issuance.
Tracks compounded rewards and bonuses.

Ensure compatibility with existing staking mechanics to prevent disruptions.

User Interface Updates:
Add an intuitive auto-staking toggle in the Vana Hub.
Display auto-staked balances and cumulative bonuses to provide transparency.


  ## Rationale
    Improved User Experience:
      Simplifies staking by eliminating repetitive manual actions.
      Consolidates staking into a single row, reducing clutter and confusion.
    Incentivized Growth:
      The bonus rewards mechanism aligns with Vana’s goal of fostering long-term participation and engagement.
      Increased Protocol Stickiness:
    Auto-staking encourages users to maintain and grow their holdings, boosting $VANA demand and reducing sell pressure.
      Efficient Resource Allocation:
      Streamlined processes reduce the need for frequent user interaction, decreasing gas fees and platform overhea


## Implementation

Implementation Path
Design Phase:
Collaborate with Vana core developers to define smart contract and interface requirements.
Estimate bonus percentage and its impact on the reward pool.
Development Phase:
Implement smart contract changes for auto-staking functionality.
Develop and test UI/UX updates in the Vana Hub.
Testing Phase:
Conduct extensive testing to ensure compatibility and security.
Perform user acceptance testing with a small group of DLP creators and stakers.
Deployment Phase:
Deploy the updated smart contract and UI/UX changes to mainnet.
Launch a community campaign to educate users about auto-staking and its benefits.

Impact Evaluation
Metrics to Track:
Adoption rate of auto-staking among users.
Average staked $VANA balance growth.
Increase in retention and engagement rates.
Expected Outcomes:
Higher staked $VANA totals.
Improved user satisfaction and platform reputation.
Long-term stabilization of $VANA tokenomics.

Open Questions
What bonus percentage will sufficiently incentivize users without overburdening the reward pool?
Should there be a lock-in period for auto-staking to qualify for bonuses, and if so, how long?

Conclusion
Auto-staking of $VANA rewards with a bonus incentive will significantly enhance user experience, promote long-term engagement, and simplify staking mechanics for DLP creators and stakers. By implementing this feature, Vana reinforces its commitment to innovation and user-centric design.
