| VRC-11 | DLP Rewards Evolution | Proposed | Technical | Art A, Colin, Anna | 2025-01-21 |

## Abstract
After two successful epochs of the DLP Rewards Program, the Vana network has reached an exciting milestone of growth and evolution. With 25k+ stakers, 3.1M verified data points, and the organic launch of numerous DataDAOs, these early epochs have been a learning phase, providing invaluable insights into the dynamics of stakers, builders, and rewards.

Feedback from the market and the DataDAO builder community revealed some challenges that need to be addressed swiftly. The current system has inadvertently incentivized low-quality, high-volume data that creates minimal value and allowed some participants to exploit reward structures in ways that are misaligned with the ecosystem's goals. To address this, we propose interim adjustments in the protocol that ensure rewards better reflect meaningful contributions while continuing to align with the broader roadmap toward an enhanced DLP rewards program.

These adjustments will focus on maintaining fairness, enabling flexibility for stakers, and fostering value accrual to DataDAOs, their tokens, and the Vana ecosystem, alongside ensuring that rewards reflect the quality and commercial potential of data contributions.

## Motivation
The initial epochs of the DLP Rewards Program were intentionally designed to be a period of experimentation. Feedback from the community and builders has underscored several key areas for improvement:
Promoting DataDAO Value: Current incentives have skewed toward low-value, high-volume data, which does not serve the network's long-term goals. Rewards must align with data quality and commercial potential while ensuring value accrues to DataDAOs and their tokens alongside VANA.
Empowering Stakers: Stakers need the tools and flexibility to engage meaningfully with DataDAOs, evaluating them on their relevance and contributions rather than simply chasing yield.
Supporting Ecosystem Alignment: The rewards structure must encourage DataDAOs to act as stewards of the ecosystem, aligning with collaborative principles and high standards of data integrity.
These interim measures reflect a broader commitment to transitioning to a more sustainable, community-driven rewards structure under the enhanced DLP rewards program.

## Specification
Key Adjustments to the DLP Rewards Program
1. Standardized APY for Stakers
The same standard APY will apply across all DLPs, similar to Epoch 1, removing uneven incentives.
UI Enhancements: The staking page will display randomized cards featuring logos, links, and 25-word pitch statements crafted by each DataDAO to highlight their value and purpose. APY and the number of stakers will not be displayed.
Rationale: This approach educates stakers, encourages critical evaluation of DataDAOs, and fosters deeper engagement and long-term mindshare for the ecosystem.

2. Flexible Staking for Contributors
The 7-day unstaking waiting period will be removed, enabling stakers to dynamically move their tokens between DataDAOs.
Rewards will remain time-weighted, ensuring long-term staking is still incentivized.
Rationale: By empowering stakers with flexibility, this change incentivizes DataDAOs to compete for community mindshare and rewards contributors for active engagement.

3. Revised Reward Structures for DataDAOs
Rewards will now be determined 100% by stake, with 0% by unique contributors.
Rationale: These changes address exploitative behavior, where participants create multiple low-quality DataDAOs to game rewards. By focusing on high-value, focused datasets, this adjustment supports long-term ecosystem growth.

4. Foundation Staking to Support Quality
The Vana Foundation will stake VANA on behalf of DataDAOs to encourage high-quality contributions.
Criteria for Foundation Staking:
Commercial Value of Data: The monetization potential and structure of the dataset, as well as the DataDAO's willingness to participate in commercialization.
Compliance with Standards: Alignment with ecosystem standards, including token architecture, data validation, and proof of contribution mechanisms.
Collaborative Conduct: The DataDAO's cooperative behavior with other DLPs, the foundation, and the broader ecosystem.
Rationale: The foundation's responsibility is to prioritize DLPs that align with the ecosystem's goals, ensuring scalability and long-term alignment.

5. Temporary Custody of Rewards to DLP Creators (Starting Epoch 2)
Beginning Epoch 2, rewards allocated to DLP creators will be custodially managed by the Vana Foundation and staked within the network as directed by each respective DLP creator.
Purpose: This measure ensures that rewards are used to support the creation of value for datasets and data tokens, fostering the development of a vibrant data marketplace.
Rationale: Providing rewards solely in VANA has constrained the growth of a marketplace for data tokens, which is critical to the ecosystem's vision. Custodial management ensures that rewards are aligned with this broader goal while the roadmap below is implemented.

## Implementation
Effective for Epoch 2:
Custodial Management: Rewards allocated to DLP creators will be managed by the Vana Foundation.
Effective for Epoch 3:
Standardized APY: Uniform APY across all DLPs, with improved UI to highlight DataDAO value propositions.
Flexible Staking: Removal of the 7-day unstaking period.
Revised Rewards: Rewards determined 100% by stake, with sublinear distribution removed.
Foundation Staking: Empowered to support quality contributions, aligned with ecosystem goals.
